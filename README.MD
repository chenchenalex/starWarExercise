# STARWAR API react table

this is a small exercise of using react and redux, redux thunk to fetch the data from starwar API (https://swapi.co/), only new data will be fetched from API

MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU, AND wear your headphone ðŸŽ§, I have warned you ðŸ˜Œ

`cd star-war-showroom && npm install && npm run start`

inside `src/contants/index.js` can modify how many items to be displayed, default is 10
